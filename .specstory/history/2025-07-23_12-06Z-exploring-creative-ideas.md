_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has sent a single word "CREATIVE" which appears to be related to the memory bank rules they have set up. Looking at the agent_requestable_workspace_rules, I can see there are various rules for different modes and levels, including creative phase related ones.

Given their request and looking at the rules available, I need to understand what they want. "CREATIVE" likely refers to entering the Creative Phase of their workflow system. 

Let me fetch the relevant rules to understand what the Creative Phase entails. I should look at:
- The main rule to understand the overall system
- Creative phase specific rules
- Creative phase architecture
- Creative phase UI/UX guidelines

Since they said "CREATIVE", I should determine what they want to do in the creative phase. But first I need to understand their current context by checking their memory bank files.

Let me start by reading the relevant memory bank files to understand their current project state, then fetch the creative phase rules.</details></think>

**UI/UX Design Guidelines and Process for the Creative Phase**

```markdown
Okay, I've updated the style guide location to `memory-bank/style-guide.md` and will provide the entire content for the new `creative-phase-uiux.md` file within a single markdown code block for easy copying. I've also reviewed the Mermaid diagrams to ensure they are correctly formatted.

# Creative Phase: UI/UX Design Guidelines

**Document Purpose:** This document outlines the structured approach for UI/UX design decisions during the Creative Phase. It ensures user-centric designs, exploration of multiple options, adherence to a style guide (if available or created), and clear documentation of UI/UX choices, aligning with React/Tailwind best practices.

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Philosophy

* **User-Centricity**: Designs must prioritize the user's needs, goals, and context.
* **Clarity & Simplicity**: Interfaces should be intuitive and easy to understand.
* **Consistency**: Maintain consistency with established design patterns, project-specific styles, and platform conventions.
* **Accessibility (A11y)**: Adhere to WCAG guidelines to ensure usability for people with disabilities.
* **Efficiency**: Enable users to accomplish tasks with minimal effort.
* **Feedback**: Provide clear and timely feedback for user actions.
* **Visual Cohesion**: Ensure new UI elements align with the existing or defined project style guide.

## 🌊 UI/UX Design Workflow

This workflow guides the UI/UX design process within the Creative Phase, incorporating a crucial style guide check.

## 📖 Style Guide Integration

A consistent visual style is paramount for good UI/UX. This section details how to reference an existing style guide or prompt for its creation. **The primary location for the style guide in this system will be `memory-bank/style-guide.md`.**

### Step 0: Style Guide Check & Handling

**A. Checking for an Existing Style Guide:**
1.  **Primary Location Check**: The system **MUST** first look for the style guide at this specific path:
    * `memory-bank/style-guide.md`
2.  **Secondary Check (User Prompt)**: If `memory-bank/style-guide.md` is not found, the system **MUST** prompt the user:
    ```
    "I could not find 'memory-bank/style-guide.md'.
    Is there an existing style guide at a different location, or a URL I should reference?
    If yes, please provide the full path or URL.
    Otherwise, we can create a basic 'memory-bank/style-guide.md' now, or you can opt to proceed without one (though this is not recommended for new UI development)."
    ```

**B. Using an Existing Style Guide:**
* If `memory-bank/style-guide.md` is found or an alternative path/URL is provided by the user:
    * Load its content into context.
    * **CRITICAL**: All subsequent UI/UX design proposals (colors, typography, spacing, component appearance) **MUST** adhere strictly to this guide.
    * When evaluating options (Step 6 of the workflow), "Adherence to Style Guide" **MUST** be a key evaluation criterion.

**C. If No Style Guide Exists or is Provided (User Interaction):**
* If no style guide is found or linked by the user, the system **MUST** strongly recommend creating one:
    ```
    "No style guide has been referenced. For optimal UI consistency and development efficiency, creating 'memory-bank/style-guide.md' is highly recommended."

    "Would you like to:"
    "1. Create a basic 'memory-bank/style-guide.md' now? (I can help you define core elements like colors, typography, and spacing based on observations or your input.)"
    "2. Proceed with UI/UX design without a style guide? (WARNING: This may lead to visual inconsistencies and is strongly discouraged for new features or significant UI changes.)"
    "Please choose 1 or 2."
    ```
    (If the user previously chose to link one but it failed, this prompt should adapt).

**D. Assisting in Style Guide Creation (If user opts-in for option 1):**
This initiates a sub-process to define and document a basic style guide, which will be saved as `memory-bank/style-guide.md`.

```mermaid
graph TD
    StartCreate["User Opts to Create Style Guide"] --> GatherInspiration["Gather Inspiration<br>(e.g., Analyze user-provided image, existing UI, or direct user input)"]
    GatherInspiration --> DefineColors["Define Core Color Palette<br>(Primary, Secondary, Accent, Neutrals, Status Colors - with hex codes)"]
    DefineColors --> DefineTypography["Define Typography<br>(Font Families, Sizes, Weights for Headings, Body, Links)"]
    DefineTypography --> DefineSpacing["Define Spacing System<br>(Base unit, margins, paddings, Tailwind scale usage)"]
    DefineSpacing --> DefineComponents["Define Key Component Styles (Conceptual)<br>(Buttons, Inputs, Cards - using Tailwind utility classes if applicable)"]
    DefineComponents --> DefineTone["Define Tone of Voice & Imagery Style (Optional)"]
    DefineTone --> GenerateDoc["Generate content for 'memory-bank/style-guide.md'<br>(Populate with defined elements)"]
    GenerateDoc --> SaveFile["Save the generated content to 'memory-bank/style-guide.md'"]
    SaveFile --> Confirm["Confirm 'memory-bank/style-guide.md' creation & Proceed with UI/UX Design"]

    style StartCreate fill:#c3e88d,stroke:#82a75c,color:black
    style GatherInspiration fill:#e0f2f1,stroke:#a7c4c0,color:black
    style SaveFile fill:#89cff0,stroke:#50a6c2,color:black
```
* **Process**:
    1.  **Inspiration**: Analyze user-provided examples (like the dashboard image `original-a5959a2926d1e7ede16dbe1d27593a59.webp`) or ask for user preferences.
        * `AI: "To create a style guide, do you have an existing design, screenshot, or website I can analyze for styles? Or would you like to define them from scratch?"`
    2.  **Define Elements**: Guide the user through defining colors, typography, spacing, and key component styles (as detailed in the previous response regarding the sample based on the image).
    3.  **Documentation**: Generate the content for `memory-bank/style-guide.md`. The structure should be similar to the sample style guide created from the dashboard image.
    4.  **Save File**: The system should then create and save this content to the file `memory-bank/style-guide.md`.
* Once `memory-bank/style-guide.md` is created/loaded, it becomes the **single source of truth for visual design**.

## 🖼️ Key UI/UX Design Considerations (To be applied using `memory-bank/style-guide.md`)

### 1. User Needs Analysis
* **Personas**: Define target user personas.
* **User Stories/Jobs-to-be-Done**: Clarify what users need to achieve.
* **Use Cases**: Detail specific interaction scenarios.

### 2. Information Architecture (IA)
* **Content Inventory & Audit**: Understand existing content.
* **Hierarchy & Structure**: Organize content logically.
* **Navigation Design**: Design intuitive navigation (menus, breadcrumbs) adhering to `memory-bank/style-guide.md` for appearance.
* **Labeling**: Use clear and consistent labels.

### 3. Interaction Design (IxD)
* **User Flows**: Map out the user's path.
* **Wireframes**: Create low-fidelity layouts.
* **Prototypes (Conceptual)**: Describe interactive elements and transitions.
* **Error Handling & Prevention**: Design clear error messages (styled per `memory-bank/style-guide.md`).
* **Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement visual/textual feedback (styled per `memory-bank/style-guide.md`).

### 4. Visual Design (Strictly follow `memory-bank/style-guide.md`)
* **Style Guide Adherence**: **CRITICAL** - All visual choices **MUST** conform to `memory-bank/style-guide.md`.
* **Visual Hierarchy**: Use the Style Guide's typography and spacing to guide the user.
* **Layout & Composition**: Arrange elements effectively using Tailwind CSS and Style Guide spacing.
* **Typography**: Apply defined font families, sizes, and weights from the Style Guide.
* **Color Palette**: Exclusively use colors defined in the Style Guide.
* **Imagery & Iconography**: Use icons and images that match the Style Guide's defined style.
* **Branding**: Align with project branding guidelines as documented in the Style Guide.

### 5. Accessibility (A11y)
* **WCAG Compliance Level**: Target AA or AAA.
* **Semantic HTML**.
* **Keyboard Navigation**.
* **ARIA Attributes**.
* **Color Contrast**: Verify against Style Guide colors.
* **Alternative Text**.

### 6. Platform & Responsiveness
* **Responsive Design**: Ensure UI adapts to screen sizes using Style Guide's responsive principles (if defined).
* **Platform Conventions**: Adhere to UI patterns for the target platform(s).

## 🛠️ UI/UX Option Evaluation & Decision Making

Reference the project's `optimized-creative-template.mdc`. Key evaluation criteria **must** include:

* Usability
* Learnability
* Efficiency
* Accessibility
* Aesthetics (as defined by `memory-bank/style-guide.md`)
* Feasibility (React/Tailwind)
* Alignment with Requirements
* **Adherence to `memory-bank/style-guide.md` (CRITICAL if guide exists)**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "UI/UX EVALUATION CRITERIA"

        C8["<b>Style Guide Adherence</b>"]
    end

    style C8 fill:#ff5555,stroke:#c30052,color:white
```

## 📝 Documentation Standards

* Use the project's `optimized-creative-template.mdc` for documenting UI/UX decisions.
* Clearly describe chosen UI patterns and rationale, referencing `memory-bank/style-guide.md`.
* Document considerations for responsive states and accessibility, as guided by `memory-bank/style-guide.md`.

## ✅ UI/UX Design Verification Checklist

- 
+ # 创意阶段：API Navigator 插件架构设计
+ 
+ ## 1️⃣ 问题定义与需求分析
+ 
+ ### 核心挑战
+ 将现有的 RestfulHelper IDEA 插件（基于 IntelliJ Platform SDK 和 PSI API）完全重新架构，转换为基于 VSCode Extension API 的 api-navigator 插件，实现相同的核心功能。
+ 
+ ### 技术转换映射表
+ | IDEA 技术栈 | VSCode 对应技术 | 转换复杂度 |
+ |------------|----------------|-----------|
+ | PSI API (Java解析) | Java AST 解析器 | **高** - 核心技术重构 |
+ | Kotlin 语言 | TypeScript | **中** - 语言特性差异 |
+ | IntelliJ Platform API | VSCode Extension API | **高** - 完全不同的API体系 |
+ | 内置索引系统 | 自建索引 + 文件监控 | **高** - 从零实现 |
+ | 插件配置描述符 | package.json + manifest | **低** - 配置格式转换 |
+ 
+ ### 核心功能需求
+ 1. **侧边栏树视图**: 显示所有 REST API 端点，包含 HTTP 方法标识
+ 2. **快捷键搜索**: CMD+\ 或 CMD+SHIFT+P 快速查找接口
+ 3. **代码导航**: 点击端点直接跳转到对应的控制器方法
+ 4. **实时同步**: 文件变更时自动更新 API 端点索引
+ 5. **Spring Boot 支持**: 第一版仅支持 Spring Boot 注解体系
+ 
+ ### 性能要求
+ - **启动时间**: < 3秒完成项目扫描
+ - **搜索响应**: < 200ms 返回搜索结果
+ - **内存使用**: < 100MB 内存占用
+ - **文件监控**: < 500ms 响应文件变更
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 2️⃣ 架构方案选项
+ 
+ ### 方案 A: 单线程同步架构
+ ```typescript
+ // 主线程处理所有任务
+ class ApiNavigatorPlugin {
+   private parser: JavaParser
+   private indexer: ApiIndexer
+   private treeView: TreeViewProvider
+   
+   async activate() {
+     // 同步扫描所有文件
+     await this.scanWorkspace()
+     this.setupFileWatcher()
+   }
+   
+   private async scanWorkspace() {
+     const javaFiles = await this.findJavaFiles()
+     for (const file of javaFiles) {
+       const ast = this.parser.parse(file)
+       this.indexer.extractEndpoints(ast)
+     }
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ **优点:**
+ - 实现简单，开发快速
+ - 调试容易，错误处理直观
+ - 内存管理简单
+ 
+ **缺点:**
+ - 大项目扫描时阻塞 UI
+ - 性能瓶颈明显
+ - 无法满足性能要求
+ 
+ **技术评估:** 🔴 不推荐
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 方案 B: Worker Threads 异步架构
+ ```typescript
+ // 主线程
+ class ApiNavigatorPlugin {
+   private workerPool: WorkerThreadPool
+   private indexer: ConcurrentIndexer
+   
+   async activate() {
+     this.workerPool = new WorkerThreadPool(4)
+     await this.scanWorkspaceAsync()
+   }
+   
+   private async scanWorkspaceAsync() {
+     const javaFiles = await this.findJavaFiles()
+     const chunks = this.chunkFiles(javaFiles, 10)
+     
+     const promises = chunks.map(chunk =>
+       this.workerPool.execute('parseFiles', chunk)
+     )
+     
+     const results = await Promise.all(promises)
+     this.indexer.mergeResults(results)
+   }
+ }
+ 
+ // worker.ts
+ import { parentPort } from 'worker_threads'
+ import { JavaASTParser } from './parser'
+ 
+ parentPort.on('message', async ({ type, data }) => {
+   if (type === 'parseFiles') {
+     const endpoints = []
+     for (const filePath of data) {
+       const ast = JavaASTParser.parseFile(filePath)
+       endpoints.push(...extractSpringEndpoints(ast))
+     }
+     parentPort.postMessage({ type: 'result', data: endpoints })
+   }
+ })
+ ```
+ 
+ **优点:**
+ - 非阻塞主线程，UI 响应流畅
+ - 支持并行处理，性能优秀
+ - 可扩展的工作线程池
+ - 支持大型项目
+ 
+ **缺点:**
+ - 架构复杂度较高
+ - Worker 通信开销
+ - 调试和错误处理复杂
+ 
+ **技术评估:** 🟢 强烈推荐
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 方案 C: 增量解析 + 缓存架构
+ ```typescript
+ class IncrementalApiIndexer {
+   private cache: Map<string, {
+     lastModified: number
+     endpoints: ApiEndpoint[]
+     dependencies: Set<string>
+   }> = new Map()
+   
+   async updateFile(filePath: string) {
+     const stat = await fs.stat(filePath)
+     const cached = this.cache.get(filePath)
+     
+     if (cached && cached.lastModified >= stat.mtime.getTime()) {
+       return cached.endpoints // 使用缓存
+     }
+     
+     // 增量解析
+     const ast = await this.parseFile(filePath)
+     const endpoints = this.extractEndpoints(ast)
+     
+     this.cache.set(filePath, {
+       lastModified: stat.mtime.getTime(),
+       endpoints,
+       dependencies: this.extractDependencies(ast)
+     })
+     
+     // 更新依赖的文件
+     await this.updateDependentFiles(filePath)
+     return endpoints
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ **优点:**
+ - 极高的更新性能
+ - 智能缓存机制
+ - 支持依赖关系追踪
+ - 内存效率高
+ 
+ **缺点:**
+ - 缓存一致性复杂
+ - 依赖分析困难
+ - 初次扫描仍然较慢
+ 
+ **技术评估:** 🟡 作为优化策略
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 方案 D: 混合架构（推荐）
+ ```typescript
+ class HybridApiNavigator {
+   private workerPool: WorkerThreadPool
+   private incrementalIndexer: IncrementalIndexer
+   private persistentCache: PersistentCache
+   
+   async activate() {
+     // 1. 启动工作线程池
+     this.workerPool = new WorkerThreadPool(4)
+     
+     // 2. 加载持久化缓存
+     await this.persistentCache.load()
+     
+     // 3. 增量扫描变更的文件
+     const changedFiles = await this.detectChangedFiles()
+     
+     if (changedFiles.length > 50) {
+       // 大量变更：使用 Worker 池全量扫描
+       await this.fullScanWithWorkers()
+     } else {
+       // 少量变更：增量更新
+       await this.incrementalUpdate(changedFiles)
+     }
+     
+     // 4. 设置文件监控
+     this.setupIncrementalFileWatcher()
+   }
+   
+   private async fullScanWithWorkers() {
+     const javaFiles = await this.findJavaFiles()
+     const chunks = this.chunkFiles(javaFiles, 20)
+     
+     const results = await Promise.all(
+       chunks.map(chunk =>
+         this.workerPool.execute('batchParse', chunk)
+       )
+     )
+     
+     this.indexer.mergeResults(results)
+     await this.persistentCache.save()
+   }
+   
+   private async incrementalUpdate(files: string[]) {
+     for (const file of files) {
+       const result = await this.incrementalIndexer.updateFile(file)
+       this.treeView.updateNode(file, result)
+     }
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ **优点:**
+ - 结合所有方案的优势
+ - 自适应性能策略
+ - 持久化缓存减少重复工作
+ - 优秀的用户体验
+ 
+ **缺点:**
+ - 架构复杂度最高
+ - 开发和测试工作量大
+ - 多种策略的协调管理
+ 
+ **技术评估:** 🟢 最佳方案
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 3️⃣ 核心组件设计
+ 
+ ### Java AST 解析器选择
+ 
+ #### 选项 1: @babel/parser + Java 语法扩展
+ ```typescript
+ import * as parser from '@babel/parser'
+ 
+ class BabelJavaParser implements JavaParser {
+   parse(content: string): JavaAST {
+     // 需要自定义 Java 语法插件
+     return parser.parse(content, {
+       sourceType: 'module',
+       plugins: ['java-syntax'] // 自定义插件
+     })
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ **评估:** 🔴 不推荐 - Babel 主要为 JavaScript 设计
+ 
+ #### 选项 2: java-ast 库
+ ```typescript
+ import { parse } from 'java-ast'
+ 
+ class JavaASTParser implements JavaParser {
+   parse(content: string): JavaAST {
+     return parse(content, {
+       tolerateErrors: true,
+       includeComments: false
+     })
+   }
+   
+   extractAnnotations(node: MethodNode): Annotation[] {
+     return node.annotations.filter(ann => 
+       SPRING_ANNOTATIONS.includes(ann.name)
+     )
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ **评估:** 🟢 推荐 - 专门为 Java 设计
+ 
+ #### 选项 3: 基于正则表达式的轻量解析器
+ ```typescript
+ class RegexJavaParser implements JavaParser {
+   private static CONTROLLER_REGEX = /@(RestController|Controller)\s*class\s+(\w+)/g
+   private static MAPPING_REGEX = /@(GetMapping|PostMapping|RequestMapping)\s*(?:\("([^"]+)"\))?\s*public\s+\w+\s+(\w+)/g
+   
+   extractEndpoints(content: string): ApiEndpoint[] {
+     const endpoints: ApiEndpoint[] = []
+     const controllers = [...content.matchAll(this.CONTROLLER_REGEX)]
+     
+     for (const controller of controllers) {
+       const mappings = [...content.matchAll(this.MAPPING_REGEX)]
+       // 解析注解和方法
+     }
+     
+     return endpoints
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ **评估:** 🟡 备选方案 - 性能优秀但功能有限
+ 
+ ### 决策: 使用 java-ast 作为主要解析器
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 4️⃣ 数据模型设计
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ // 核心数据模型
+ interface ApiEndpoint {
+   id: string                    // 唯一标识符
+   method: HttpMethod           // GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
+   path: string                 // API 路径，如 /api/users/{id}
+   controllerClass: string      // 控制器类名
+   methodName: string           // 方法名
+   parameters: Parameter[]      // 参数列表
+   location: CodeLocation       // 代码位置信息
+   annotations: Annotation[]    // 注解信息
+ }
+ 
+ interface CodeLocation {
+   filePath: string
+   startLine: number
+   endLine: number
+   startColumn: number
+   endColumn: number
+ }
+ 
+ interface Parameter {
+   name: string
+   type: string
+   isPathVariable: boolean
+   isRequestParam: boolean
+   isRequestBody: boolean
+ }
+ 
+ // 索引管理
+ class ApiEndpointIndex {
+   private endpoints: Map<string, ApiEndpoint> = new Map()
+   private pathIndex: Map<string, Set<string>> = new Map()
+   private classIndex: Map<string, Set<string>> = new Map()
+   
+   addEndpoint(endpoint: ApiEndpoint): void {
+     this.endpoints.set(endpoint.id, endpoint)
+     this.updateIndices(endpoint)
+   }
+   
+   searchByPath(pattern: string): ApiEndpoint[] {
+     // 模糊搜索实现
+     return Array.from(this.endpoints.values())
+       .filter(ep => ep.path.includes(pattern))
+   }
+   
+   findByMethod(method: HttpMethod): ApiEndpoint[] {
+     return Array.from(this.endpoints.values())
+       .filter(ep => ep.method === method)
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 5️⃣ UI/UX 设计方案
+ 
+ ### 侧边栏树视图设计
+ ```typescript
+ class ApiTreeViewProvider implements vscode.TreeDataProvider<TreeNode> {
+   private _onDidChangeTreeData = new vscode.EventEmitter<TreeNode | undefined>()
+   readonly onDidChangeTreeData = this._onDidChangeTreeData.event
+   
+   getChildren(element?: TreeNode): TreeNode[] {
+     if (!element) {
+       // 根节点：按控制器分组
+       return this.groupByController()
+     } else if (element.type === 'controller') {
+       // 控制器节点：显示该控制器的所有端点
+       return this.getEndpointsByController(element.id)
+     }
+     return []
+   }
+   
+   getTreeItem(element: TreeNode): vscode.TreeItem {
+     const item = new vscode.TreeItem(
+       element.label,
+       element.type === 'controller' 
+         ? vscode.TreeItemCollapsibleState.Expanded
+         : vscode.TreeItemCollapsibleState.None
+     )
+     
+     if (element.type === 'endpoint') {
+       item.iconPath = this.getMethodIcon(element.method)
+       item.command = {
+         command: 'apiNavigator.gotoEndpoint',
+         title: 'Go to endpoint',
+         arguments: [element.location]
+       }
+     }
+     
+     return item
+   }
+ }
+ 
+ // 树节点图标设计
+ interface TreeNodeIcon {
+   GET: 'symbol-method'      // 绿色方法图标
+   POST: 'symbol-constructor' // 蓝色构造函数图标
+   PUT: 'symbol-property'    // 橙色属性图标
+   DELETE: 'symbol-operator' // 红色操作符图标
+   PATCH: 'symbol-event'     // 紫色事件图标
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 搜索面板设计
+ ```typescript
+ class ApiSearchProvider implements vscode.QuickPickProvider {
+   async provideQuickPickItems(
+     token: vscode.CancellationToken
+   ): Promise<vscode.QuickPickItem[]> {
+     const endpoints = await this.indexer.getAllEndpoints()
+     
+     return endpoints.map(endpoint => ({
+       label: `${endpoint.method} ${endpoint.path}`,
+       description: `${endpoint.controllerClass}.${endpoint.methodName}`,
+       detail: endpoint.location.filePath,
+       endpoint: endpoint
+     }))
+   }
+   
+   async onDidSelectItem(item: any): Promise<void> {
+     if (item.endpoint) {
+       await vscode.commands.executeCommand(
+         'apiNavigator.gotoEndpoint',
+         item.endpoint.location
+       )
+     }
+   }
+ }
+ ```

+ 
+ ## 6️⃣ 性能优化策略
+ 
+ ### 内存管理
+ ```typescript
+ class MemoryOptimizedIndexer {
+   private readonly MAX_CACHE_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024 // 50MB
+   private cache = new Map<string, WeakRef<ApiEndpoint[]>>()
+   
+   private cleanupCache(): void {
+     for (const [key, weakRef] of this.cache.entries()) {
+       if (!weakRef.deref()) {
+         this.cache.delete(key)
+       }
+     }
+   }
+   
+   getEndpoints(filePath: string): ApiEndpoint[] | undefined {
+     const weakRef = this.cache.get(filePath)
+     return weakRef?.deref()
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 文件监控优化
+ ```typescript
+ class OptimizedFileWatcher {
+   private debounceMap = new Map<string, NodeJS.Timeout>()
+   
+   setupWatcher(): void {
+     const watcher = vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(
+       '**/*.java',
+       false, // 不忽略创建
+       false, // 不忽略修改
+       false  // 不忽略删除
+     )
+     
+     watcher.onDidChange(uri => {
+       this.debouncedUpdate(uri.fsPath, 'change')
+     })
+   }
+   
+   private debouncedUpdate(filePath: string, type: string): void {
+     const existing = this.debounceMap.get(filePath)
+     if (existing) {
+       clearTimeout(existing)
+     }
+     
+     const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
+       this.updateFile(filePath, type)
+       this.debounceMap.delete(filePath)
+     }, 300) // 300ms 防抖
+     
+     this.debounceMap.set(filePath, timeout)
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+

_**User**_

补充一个细节，Spring 的端点是 Controller 类的 @RequestMapping + 具体函数上面的 @GetMapping、@PostMapping 组合而来

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>用户补充了一个重要的细节，关于Spring端点的组合方式。用户提到Spring的端点是通过Controller类上的@RequestMapping注解和具体函数上的@GetMapping、@PostMapping等注解组合而来的。

这是一个很重要的技术细节，我需要更新创意阶段的架构设计文档，特别是在Java解析和注解处理的部分，确保我们的设计方案能够正确处理这种注解组合的情况。

让我看看现有的创意文档，然后添加这个重要的细节。我需要：

1. 在架构设计文档中添加这个Spring注解组合的详细说明
2. 更新Java解析器的设计，确保能够正确处理类级别和方法级别的注解组合
3. 在数据模型中体现这种层次化的注解结构
4. 确保URL路径组合逻辑的正确性

这个细节对于正确实现Spring Boot API端点发现非常关键。</details></think>

---

[[memory:4120396]] 非常好的补充！这是一个关键的技术细节。Spring Boot 的 URL 路径确实是通过**类级别的 `@RequestMapping`** 和**方法级别的映射注解**（如 `@GetMapping`、`@PostMapping` 等）组合而成的。让我更新创意设计文档来详细说明这个重要的实现细节。

```diff
  
  ## 3️⃣ 核心组件设计
+ 
+ ### Spring Boot 注解组合逻辑 ⭐
+ 
+ #### 关键实现细节
+ Spring Boot API 端点的完整路径由**两层注解组合**而成：
+ 
+ ```java
+ @RestController
+ @RequestMapping("/api/users")    // 类级别基础路径
+ public class UserController {
+     
+     @GetMapping("/{id}")         // 方法级别路径
+     public User getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
+         // 最终路径: GET /api/users/{id}
+     }
+     
+     @PostMapping("/register")    // 方法级别路径  
+     public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
+         // 最终路径: POST /api/users/register
+     }
+     
+     @RequestMapping(value = "/search", method = RequestMethod.GET)
+     public List<User> searchUsers(@RequestParam String query) {
+         // 最终路径: GET /api/users/search
+     }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ #### 路径组合规则
+ ```typescript
+ class SpringUrlComposer {
+   composeFullPath(classMapping: string, methodMapping: string): string {
+     // 1. 清理和标准化路径
+     const cleanClassPath = this.cleanPath(classMapping)
+     const cleanMethodPath = this.cleanPath(methodMapping)
+     
+     // 2. 组合路径
+     if (!cleanClassPath) return cleanMethodPath || '/'
+     if (!cleanMethodPath) return cleanClassPath
+     
+     // 3. 避免重复的斜杠
+     const basePath = cleanClassPath.endsWith('/') 
+       ? cleanClassPath.slice(0, -1) 
+       : cleanClassPath
+     const methodPath = cleanMethodPath.startsWith('/') 
+       ? cleanMethodPath 
+       : '/' + cleanMethodPath
+     
+     return basePath + methodPath
+   }
+   
+   private cleanPath(path: string): string {
+     if (!path) return ''
+     // 去除引号，处理变量替换
+     return path.replace(/['"]/g, '').replace(/\$\{([^}]+)\}/g, '{$1}')
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Java AST 解析器设计（更新）
+ 
+ #### 完整的注解解析流程
+ ```typescript
+ class SpringAnnotationParser {
+   parseController(classNode: ClassNode): ControllerInfo {
+     const controllerInfo: ControllerInfo = {
+       className: classNode.name,
+       classLevelMapping: this.extractClassMapping(classNode),
+       methods: []
+     }
+     
+     // 解析每个方法
+     for (const method of classNode.methods) {
+       const methodInfo = this.parseMethod(method, controllerInfo.classLevelMapping)
+       if (methodInfo) {
+         controllerInfo.methods.push(methodInfo)
+       }
+     }
+     
+     return controllerInfo
+   }

+   private extractClassMapping(classNode: ClassNode): string {
+     // 查找类级别的 @RequestMapping
+     const requestMappingAnnotation = classNode.annotations.find(
+       ann => ann.name === 'RequestMapping'
+     )
+     
+     if (requestMappingAnnotation) {
+       // 提取 value 或 path 属性
+       return this.extractMappingValue(requestMappingAnnotation) || ''
+     }
+     
+     return '' // 没有类级别映射
+   }
+   
+   private parseMethod(methodNode: MethodNode, classMapping: string): ApiEndpoint | null {
+     // 检查是否有映射注解
+     const mappingAnnotation = this.findMappingAnnotation(methodNode)

+       case 'PutMapping': return 'PUT'
+       case 'DeleteMapping': return 'DELETE'
+       case 'PatchMapping': return 'PATCH'
+       case 'RequestMapping':
+         // 从 method 属性中提取
+         const methodValue = annotation.attributes?.method
+         if (methodValue) {
+           return this.parseRequestMethod(methodValue)
+         }
+         return 'GET' // 默认值
+       default:
+         return 'GET'
+     }
+   }
+   
+   private parseRequestMethod(methodValue: string): HttpMethod {
+     // 处理 RequestMethod.GET 格式
+     if (methodValue.includes('RequestMethod.')) {
+       return methodValue.split('.')[1] as HttpMethod
+     }
+     return methodValue.toUpperCase() as HttpMethod
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ #### 数据结构更新
+ ```typescript
+ interface ControllerInfo {
+   className: string
+   classLevelMapping: string      // 类级别的 @RequestMapping 路径
+   methods: ApiEndpoint[]
+ }
+ 
+ interface ApiEndpoint {
+   id: string
+   method: HttpMethod
+   path: string                   // 完整组合后的路径
+   classMapping: string           // 类级别路径部分
+   methodMapping: string          // 方法级别路径部分
+   controllerClass: string
+   methodName: string
+   parameters: Parameter[]
+   location: CodeLocation
+   annotations: Annotation[]
+ }
+ 
+ // 新增：路径组合信息
+ interface PathComposition {
+   classPath: string              // 来自类级别 @RequestMapping
+   methodPath: string             // 来自方法级别映射注解

[[memory:4120396]] 完美！感谢您提供这个关键的技术细节！我已经全面更新了创意设计文档，详细说明了 **Spring Boot 注解组合逻辑**。这确实是实现正确 API 端点发现的核心机制。

## 🎯 已更新的关键内容

### 1. **Spring 注解组合逻辑详解**
我添加了完整的两层注解组合说明：
- **类级别**: `@RequestMapping("/api/users")` - 定义基础路径
- **方法级别**: `@GetMapping("/{id}")` - 定义具体端点路径
- **组合结果**: `/api/users` + `/{id}` = `/api/users/{id}`

### 2. **技术实现方案**
```typescript
class SpringUrlComposer {
  composeFullPath(classMapping: string, methodMapping: string): string {
    // 处理路径清理、斜杠规范化、变量替换等
    const cleanClassPath = this.cleanPath(classMapping)
    const cleanMethodPath = this.cleanPath(methodMapping)
    
    // 智能组合逻辑
    return basePath + methodPath
  }
}
```

### 3. **数据模型扩展**
更新了 `ApiEndpoint` 接口，新增：
- `classMapping`: 类级别路径部分
- `methodMapping`: 方法级别路径部分  
- `pathComposition`: 路径组合详细信息

### 4. **完整解析流程**
```typescript
parseController(classNode) {
  const classMapping = extractClassMapping(classNode)  // @RequestMapping
  for (const method of classNode.methods) {
    const methodMapping = extractMethodMapping(method) // @GetMapping 等
    const fullPath = composeFullPath(classMapping, methodMapping)
    // 创建完整的 ApiEndpoint
  }
}
```

### 5. **与原插件对比**
我参考了原 IDEA 插件的 `SpringMappingAnnotation.kt` 实现，确保我们的新架构能够准确复制相同的注解处理逻辑。

## ✅ 关键优势

这个详细的注解组合处理确保：
- **准确性**: 正确处理所有 Spring Boot 路径组合场景
- **兼容性**: 支持各种注解组合方式（类有路径、类无路径、方法级 `@RequestMapping` 等）
- **可追溯性**: 保留原始的类路径和方法路径信息，便于调试和展示
- **测试友好**: 提供了完整的测试用例验证

现在架构设计已经包含了这个核心的 Spring Boot 特性！准备好进入 **IMPLEMENT** 阶段了吗？ 🚀

Git 检测到 RestfulHelper 目录包含一个嵌入的 Git 仓库。让我先检查状态并处理这个问题：

🎉 **所有 Git 配置完全完成！**

## 📊 最终状态总览

### ✅ Git 仓库状态
```
📍 当前分支: main  
📍 远程仓库: git@github.com:xkcoding/API-Navigator.git
📍 提交历史: 
   - fb4e972 📝 更新任务状态：Git仓库初始化完成
   - c2999eb 🎉 初始化 API Navigator 项目 (root-commit)
```

### 🔗 子模块配置
```
📦 RestfulHelper (v0.4.7-stable)
📦 来源: git@github.com:Nayacco/RestfulHelper.git  
📦 状态: bc51117 - 已锁定版本，可随时更新
```

### 📂 项目结构
```
API Navigator/
├── .git/                        # Git 仓库配置
├── .gitignore                   # 完整忽略规则
├── .gitmodules                  # 子模块配置
├── README.md                    # 项目说明文档
├── RestfulHelper/               # 子模块：原IDEA插件参考
└── memory-bank/                 # Memory Bank系统文档
    ├── tasks.md ✅              # 任务跟踪（已更新）
    ├── creative/                # 创意阶段设计文档
    └── ... (14个文件)
```

## 🎯 关键优势

1. **版本控制隔离**: 仅在当前项目配置提交人信息，不影响其他项目
2. **智能依赖管理**: RestfulHelper 作为子模块，便于跟踪上游更新
3. **完整文档体系**: Memory Bank + README + 架构设计文档齐全
4. **GitHub 集成**: 自动同步到远程仓库，便于协作和备份

## 🚀 下一步操作

现在您可以：
1. **查看项目**: 访问 https://github.com/xkcoding/API-Navigator
2. **开始实施**: 输入 `IMPLEMENT` 进入开发阶段
3. **克隆项目**: 其他开发者可以通过 `git clone --recursive` 完整克隆

项目的版本控制基础已经完美建立！准备好开始编码实施了吗？ 🎨→🛠️

是否需要将 `克隆项目: 其他开发者可以通过 git clone --recursive 完整克隆` 这个信息补充在 @README.md 中

并且当前 README 提到的 LICENSE 文件也帮忙创建一下

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>用户提到了两个很好的建议：
1. 在 README.md 中补充 `git clone --recursive` 的克隆说明，这对于包含子模块的项目确实很重要
2. 创建 LICENSE 文件，因为 README.md 中提到了 MIT License 但实际文件不存在

让我先更新 README.md 添加克隆说明，然后创建 MIT License 文件。</details></think>

---

[[memory:4120396]] 非常好的建议！确实需要补充子模块克隆说明和创建 LICENSE 文件。让我来更新这两个内容。

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>现在需要创建 MIT License 文件。让我创建一个标准的 MIT License，需要包含年份和版权所有者信息。根据用户信息，应该是 xkcoding (Yangkai.Shen)。</details></think>

---

现在创建 MIT License 文件：

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>现在需要更新 README.md 的项目结构部分，因为新增了 LICENSE 文件。我也应该在 README.md 中更新项目结构以反映实际情况。</details></think>

---

让我也更新 README.md 中的项目结构，反映实际的文件布局：

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>现在已经完成了：
1. 在 README.md 中添加了 Git 子模块的克隆说明
2. 创建了 MIT License 文件
3. 更新了项目结构说明

现在需要提交这些更改到 Git 仓库。</details></think>

---

现在提交这些更新到 Git 仓库：

---

```bash
git status
```

_**User**_

我期望把 .cursor .specstory .memory-bank  这 3 个文件夹一并提交上去，方便其他期望开始 AI 结对编程的同学可以针对本项目从 0 开始复刻
